## 2026-07-10 — Workspace bootstrap

**Done:**
- Researched challenge (repo + official site) → `docs/challenge_brief.md`
- Researched Claude plan economics → `docs/claude_budget.md`. Critical: **Fable 5 leaves subscriptions 12 Jul**; recommended Max 5x upgrade before then, downgrade after 15 Aug.
- Researched NUS SoC cluster → `docs/soc_cluster_guide.md` (access steps verified from public guides; storage/partition TODOs flagged)
- Wrote `docs/master_plan.md` (4 phases), `docs/windows_workplan.md` (core/adapter split so ~70% of dev happens on Windows), `docs/architecture.md` (draft v0.1, SORT3D-style)
- Cloned official repo → `upstream/CMU-VLN-Challenge-2026` (git-ignored reference)
- git init + first commit

**Decisions:**
- SORT3D-style architecture (explicit 3D object map + LLM reasoning via API — allowed by rules) over end-to-end VLA training
- `ai_module` split: pure-Python `core/` (Windows-testable) + thin `ros_adapter/`
- Cluster reserved for optional fine-tuning; sim work waits for native Ubuntu (WSL2 = time-boxed stretch)

**Next step (Phase 0, Fable window — before 12 Jul):**
1. USER: register for the challenge (deadline 15 Jul) + decide on Max upgrade
2. Upstream deep-dive → `docs/upstream_notes.md`
3. Question JSON analysis → `docs/question_analysis.md`
4. Prior-art research → `docs/prior_art.md`
5. Harden `architecture.md`, then scaffold `src/core/`
