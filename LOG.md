## 2026-07-10 — Workspace bootstrap

**Done:**
- Researched challenge (repo + official site) → `docs/challenge_brief.md`
- Researched Claude plan economics → `docs/claude_budget.md`. Critical: **Fable 5 leaves subscriptions 12 Jul**; recommended Max 5x upgrade before then, downgrade after 15 Aug.
- Researched NUS SoC cluster → `docs/soc_cluster_guide.md` (access steps verified from public guides; storage/partition TODOs flagged)
- Wrote `docs/master_plan.md` (4 phases), `docs/windows_workplan.md` (core/adapter split so ~70% of dev happens on Windows), `docs/architecture.md` (draft v0.1, SORT3D-style)
- Cloned official repo → `upstream/CMU-VLN-Challenge-2026` (git-ignored reference)
- git init + first commit

**Decisions:**
- SORT3D-style architecture (explicit 3D object map + LLM reasoning via API — allowed by rules) over end-to-end VLA training
- `ai_module` split: pure-Python `core/` (Windows-testable) + thin `ros_adapter/`
- Cluster reserved for optional fine-tuning; sim work waits for native Ubuntu (WSL2 = time-boxed stretch)

**Next step (Phase 0, Fable window — before 12 Jul):**
1. USER: register for the challenge (deadline 15 Jul) + decide on Max upgrade
2. Upstream deep-dive → `docs/upstream_notes.md`
3. Question JSON analysis → `docs/question_analysis.md`
4. Prior-art research → `docs/prior_art.md`
5. Harden `architecture.md`, then scaffold `src/core/`

## 2026-07-10 (session 2) — Prior-art deep research

**Done:**
- Deep research across published work → `docs/prior_art.md` (SORT3D method + numbers, Transcrib3D, VLA-3D/IRef-VLA, VLFM, 3D-Mem, OpenEQA, ConceptGraphs, Open-Nav, sequential grounding, perception-stack consensus table, reading list)
- Architecture bumped to v0.2 with prior-art validation note
- Upstream repo finished cloning → `upstream/CMU-VLN-Challenge-2026` ✓

**Key findings:**
- **SORT3D (arXiv:2504.18684) is the challenge organisers' own zero-shot system, already integrated with our exact autonomy stack + Unity sim.** It is the blueprint; no license in repo — concepts only until checked.
- Zero-shot object-map + LLM beats supervised 3D models → **fine-tuning demoted to optional**; SoC cluster no longer critical-path.
- Literature gaps we can exploit: 10-min time-budgeted exploration, deterministic count-filters (numericals), multi-constraint verification, self-consistency on 6-pt questions.
- 2025 3rd place was a CMU MRSD team; no public technical reports found — recheck IROS-25 workshop proceedings later.

**Next step:**
1. USER: register (by 15 Jul!) + Max decision
2. Read the two CMU MSR theses (links in prior_art.md reading list)
3. Upstream deep-dive → `docs/upstream_notes.md` (clone is now local)
4. Question JSON analysis → `docs/question_analysis.md`
5. Then scaffold `src/core/`

## 2026-07-10 (session 3) — Delegated deep-dives, verified

Work fanned out to role agents; results independently verified where fact-heavy.

**Done:**
- `docs/upstream_notes.md` — full upstream distillation incl. autonomy-stack submodule (fetched at pinned `81035e9` after fixing a broken shallow checkout). Highlights: relaunch-per-question, 1 Hz question republish, Marker scored by GT overlap + its center used as nav goal, Pose2D heading ignored (radians if ever enabled), terrain map = XYZI cloud with intensity = obstacle height (m), traversable < ~0.1–0.2 m, waypointConverter snaps infeasible waypoints, **TARE/FAR planners NOT launched at test time and their triggers aren't allowed topics → we implement our own exploration**, CycloneDDS + Unity TCP bridge on :10000, keep waypoints near the vehicle.
- `docs/question_analysis.md` — 75 Q / 255 pts; instruction-following **70.6% of points**; relations: on(48), closest-to(37), near(33), between(17); zero egocentric phrasing; only 10 attribute mentions; no GT answers in JSON (only trajectory PLYs); "refridgerator" typo. **All claims independently re-computed and CONFIRMED by a fresh-context verification pass.**
- `docs/organizer_playbook.md` — organiser theses distilled (toolbox-over-raw-LLM-geometry, +11.6-pt captioning gain, fisheye-VO failure warning → lidar for geometry / camera for semantics). 2025 3rd place: CMU MRSD "CopyPasta" (Gemini 2.5 Pro + ROS state machine); no public leaderboard/scores found (challenge site 404s, IROS-25 workshop not archived).

**Decisions:**
- Exploration is on us (built-in planners off at test time) — actuate only via `/way_point_with_heading`.
- Documentation and commits carry no tooling attribution (user rule, applies from session 3 onward).

**Next step:** independent architecture proposals by parallel frontier-model agents → structured critique → merged architecture v1.0 with full citations (plagiarism-safe: no unlicensed code reuse, concepts attributed).
