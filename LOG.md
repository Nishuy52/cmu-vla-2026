## 2026-07-10 — Workspace bootstrap

**Done:**
- Researched challenge (repo + official site) → `docs/challenge_brief.md`
- Researched Claude plan economics → `docs/claude_budget.md`. Critical: **Fable 5 leaves subscriptions 12 Jul**; recommended Max 5x upgrade before then, downgrade after 15 Aug.
- Researched NUS SoC cluster → `docs/soc_cluster_guide.md` (access steps verified from public guides; storage/partition TODOs flagged)
- Wrote `docs/master_plan.md` (4 phases), `docs/windows_workplan.md` (core/adapter split so ~70% of dev happens on Windows), `docs/architecture.md` (draft v0.1, SORT3D-style)
- Cloned official repo → `upstream/CMU-VLN-Challenge-2026` (git-ignored reference)
- git init + first commit

**Decisions:**
- SORT3D-style architecture (explicit 3D object map + LLM reasoning via API — allowed by rules) over end-to-end VLA training
- `ai_module` split: pure-Python `core/` (Windows-testable) + thin `ros_adapter/`
- Cluster reserved for optional fine-tuning; sim work waits for native Ubuntu (WSL2 = time-boxed stretch)

**Next step (Phase 0, Fable window — before 12 Jul):**
1. USER: register for the challenge (deadline 15 Jul) + decide on Max upgrade
2. Upstream deep-dive → `docs/upstream_notes.md`
3. Question JSON analysis → `docs/question_analysis.md`
4. Prior-art research → `docs/prior_art.md`
5. Harden `architecture.md`, then scaffold `src/core/`

## 2026-07-10 (session 2) — Prior-art deep research

**Done:**
- Deep research across published work → `docs/prior_art.md` (SORT3D method + numbers, Transcrib3D, VLA-3D/IRef-VLA, VLFM, 3D-Mem, OpenEQA, ConceptGraphs, Open-Nav, sequential grounding, perception-stack consensus table, reading list)
- Architecture bumped to v0.2 with prior-art validation note
- Upstream repo finished cloning → `upstream/CMU-VLN-Challenge-2026` ✓

**Key findings:**
- **SORT3D (arXiv:2504.18684) is the challenge organisers' own zero-shot system, already integrated with our exact autonomy stack + Unity sim.** It is the blueprint; no license in repo — concepts only until checked.
- Zero-shot object-map + LLM beats supervised 3D models → **fine-tuning demoted to optional**; SoC cluster no longer critical-path.
- Literature gaps we can exploit: 10-min time-budgeted exploration, deterministic count-filters (numericals), multi-constraint verification, self-consistency on 6-pt questions.
- 2025 3rd place was a CMU MRSD team; no public technical reports found — recheck IROS-25 workshop proceedings later.

**Next step:**
1. USER: register (by 15 Jul!) + Max decision
2. Read the two CMU MSR theses (links in prior_art.md reading list)
3. Upstream deep-dive → `docs/upstream_notes.md` (clone is now local)
4. Question JSON analysis → `docs/question_analysis.md`
5. Then scaffold `src/core/`
